# Prolem 1

The chunk below creates a data frame comprised of: a random sample of size 10 from a standard normal distriution, a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0, a character vector of length 10, a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor "levels".

```{r problem_1}

library(tidyverse)

df = tibble (norm_samp = rnorm (10),
             vec_logical = as.logical (norm_samp > 0),
             vec_char = c ("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
             vec_factor = c ("yes", "maybe", "no", "yes", "no", "maybe", "yes", "no", "maybe", "yes")
)

mean_norm_samp = mean (pull (df, norm_samp))
mean_vec_char = mean (pull (df, vec_char))
mean_vec_factor = mean (pull (df, vec_factor))

```

This code chunk is to: 
  * convert the logical vector to numeric, and multiply the random sample by the result
  * convert the logical vector to a factor, and multiply the random sample by the result
  * convert the logical vector to a factor and then convert the result to numeric, and multiply the random sample by the result

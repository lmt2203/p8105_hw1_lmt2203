This is my solution to HW1.

## Prolem 1

The chunk below creates a data frame comprised of variables.

``` r
prob1_df =  tibble (
             samp = rnorm (10),
             vec_logical = samp > 0,
             vec_char = c ("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
             vec_factor = factor (c("yes", "maybe", "no", "yes", "no", "maybe", "yes", "no", "maybe", "yes"))
)
```

Take the mean of each variable in my data frame.

``` r
mean(pull(prob1_df, samp))
mean(pull(prob1_df, vec_logical))
mean(pull(prob1_df, vec_char))
mean(pull(prob1_df, vec_factor))
```

I can take the mean of numbers and logical but not character or factor.

The chunk below converts variables to numeric and multiplys the random
sample by the result

``` r
as.numeric (pull(prob1_df, samp))
as.numeric (pull(prob1_df, vec_logical))
as.numeric (pull(prob1_df, vec_char))
as.numeric (pull(prob1_df, vec_factor))

as.numeric (pull(prob1_df, vec_logical)) * pull (prob1_df, samp)
as.factor (pull(prob1_df, vec_logical)) * pull (prob1_df, samp)
as.numeric (as.factor (pull(prob1_df, vec_logical))) * pull (prob1_df, samp)
```

This is the end of Problem 1.

## Problem 2

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

  - Some descriptions of the penguins dataset:
      - The categories of the variables in the dataset are: species,
        island, bill\_length\_mm, bill\_depth\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm,
        body\_mass\_g, sex, year. The total number of penguins in this
        dataset is 344.
      - The species of the penguins in the dataset are Adelie,
        Chinstrap, Gentoo and they are distributed on Biscoe, Dream,
        Torgersen islands.
      - The dataset has **344** rows and **8** columns.
      - The mean flipper length is **200.9152047**.

This code chunk generates a scatterplot of x and y

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point(na.rm = TRUE)
```
